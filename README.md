# QC-partial-charges-AMBER
A step-by-step procedure for calculating partial atomic charges compatible with the AMBER General Force Field (GAFF) uses quantum chemical calculations with GAMESS and RESP fitting via Antechamber.

## System Setup
First, you need a PDB or XYZ file of your molecule. If the structure is unavailable, you can easily build it using molecular editing and visualization software such as Avogadro, VMD, PyMOL, etc. 
Below is an example of a biobinder PDB file used in this tutorial.
