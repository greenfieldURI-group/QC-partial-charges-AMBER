GAMESS_to_RESP
************************************************************************************
 This C++ program converts the .dat output file generated by the GAMESS-US package
 into the required input format for the RESP charge fitting procedure.
 
 Author: Faramarz Joodaki 
 Research Group: Professor Michael L. Greenfield
 Institution: University of Rhode Island

 Purpose:
 - Parse electrostatic potential (ESP) data from GAMESS-US .dat files
 - Format atomic coordinates and ESP grid points for compatibility with the RESP fitting tool
 - Make first step RESP input files.
 
 Please cite appropriately if this code is used in any published work.

 Input files
 - GAMESS generated dat file that includes ESP information
 - gamess-resp.in that users need to prepare it.

 Parameters in gamess-resp.in 
 - gamess-dat-file: Path and filename of the GAMESS-generated .dat file.
 - qc_min: Indicates whether quantum chemical minimization was performed before ESP calculation (YES or NO)
 - net_charge: The net charge of the system.
 
 Installation
 cd GAMESS_to_RESP directory
 make
 
 Uninstallation
 clean make
 
 Running GAMESS_to_RESP
 To execute the program, run the GamessToResp executable from the command line:
